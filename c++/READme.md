## working with classes in c++


follow the example in the main.cpp file and you should be able to 
update the DIY.cpp code to work 

## running the  code 

For linux users you need to compile the code with g++ to an executable file 

``` bash 
 g++ file_name -o output_name

```

after that you can run the code by simply 

``` bash 
  ./file_name
```

happy coding....
